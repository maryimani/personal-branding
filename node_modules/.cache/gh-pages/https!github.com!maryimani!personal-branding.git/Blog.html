    <h2>GBV Advocate</h2>
        <p class="gbv"><strong>Today across the globe, violence, oppression and discrimination prevent millions from living up to their God-given potential ,Harmful traditional beliefs about the role of girls and women, tribal and ethnic divisions, and cultural stigmas that marginalize the disabled, widowed, or abused, strip many from the fullness of life they deserve.But today, I change that.Gender-based violence is one of the most prevalent human rights violations in the world. It knows no social, economic or national boundaries.
            I impacts women and girls in different ways,when a woman has been subjected to gender-based violence, she has short and long-term consequences for her physical, mental and sexual and reproductive health. </strong>
         </p>
    <div class="advocate">
        
         <div style="flex-grow:1">
            <p>Injuries, unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections and gynaecological disorders, as well as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and even self-harm. For example, survivors of intimate partner violence have a twofold increased risk of undergoing an induced abortion, and are 50 per cent more likely to have a sexually transmitted infection or HIV. 
                Gender-based violence is not only a violation of individual womens' ,mens' and girls' rights. The impunity enjoyed by perpetrators, and the fear generated by their actions, has an effect on all women ,men and girls. It also takes a toll on a global level, stunting the contributions women,men and girls can make to international development, peace and progress.</p>
